# project-Facial-Expression-Recognition
- project paper: Exploration of Multiple Methods in Solving Facial Expression Recognition Problems
- Built and trained SVM Classifier, CNN and GNN on FE2R013 and CK+ datasets for facial expression recognition.
- SVM and GNN codes for this project are not open-sourced as certain team members' requirement, CNN part is modified from https://github.com/WuJie1010/Facial-Expression-Recognition.Pytorch.
